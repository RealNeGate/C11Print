# NL (NeGate's Libraries)

Just a series of random "libraries" which I've produced for C11+ (some might support earlier versions).

In Progress:
 - Topaz.h (a tiny cross-platform 2D GL renderer for games and apps)
 - Str.h (non-null terminated strings and string builders)
 - Hash.h (Hash maps and a series of hashing functions)
 - DynArray.h (Dynamically sized arrays)

Completed:
 - Print.h
